# Javascript-Basics
I started Javascript basics revision and I put all the code/tasks in this repository which I performed during my internship program at NISUM Karachi. This repository is made for record purposes.
For revision, I used a course available at "https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript" for reference purposes. You may find some code snippets similar from the course in this repository, that are used for practice purposes.

- Screenshot of the Codecademy course progress with all the topics covered is given below.
