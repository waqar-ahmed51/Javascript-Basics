# Javascript-Basics
 I started Javascript basics revision and I put all the code/task in this repository which I performed during my internship program at NISUM Karachi. This repository is made for record purpose.
 - For revision I used "https://www.codecademy.com/" for reference purpose. You may find some code examples already available at the website.
