# Javascript-Basics
 I started Javascript basics revision and I put all the code/task in this repository which I performed during my internship program at NISUM Karachi. This repository is made for record purpose.
 - For revision I used a course avaiable at "https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript" for reference purpose. You may find some code snippets from the website.
