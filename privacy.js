//Certain languages have privacy built-in for objects, 
//but JavaScript does not have this feature.
// Rather, JavaScript developers follow naming conventions that signal 
//to other developers how to interact with a property. 
//One common convention is to place an underscore _ before the 
//name of a property to mean that the property should not be altered. Hereâ€™s an example of using _ to prepend a property.
